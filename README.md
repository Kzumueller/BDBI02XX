# BDBI02XX

a little project in the course of my B.Sc.  
A forum using JSP, though I doubt anyone is till using that for new projects.  
Some file names I did not choose so they are in German but the project features homebrewn localization.  
There is also a rudimentary dependency injection container I've been playing around with (hence the 'kata' tag).
